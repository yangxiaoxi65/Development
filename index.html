            <p>
                We conducted an A/B test to see if we could design a webpage that helps users find what they're looking for more quickly. This test compares two versions: the original and a redesigned version focused on improving navigation.

            <h2>Our Experiment</h2>
            <p>
                The experiment involved two versions: Version A (our original page) and Version B (our redesigned page). The goal of Version B was to make it easier for users to find their target quickly. Below are the screenshots of Version A and Version B:

                <p><strong>Null Hypothesis (H0):</strong> The misclick rate is the same for both version A and version B of the webpage.</p>
                <p><strong>Alternative Hypothesis (H1):</strong> Version B of the webpage has a lower misclick rate than version A.</p>
                <p><strong>Reasoning for Alternative Hypothesis:</strong> The design changes in version B were intended to make navigation more intuitive, potentially leading to fewer misclicks as users can find their intended targets more easily.</p>
                <p><strong>Prediction with Justification:</strong> We anticipate rejecting the null hypothesis, as the streamlined design of version B should result in a lower rate of misclicks.</p>

                <p><strong>Alternative Hypothesis (H1):</strong> Users spend less time on average on version B of the webpage compared to version A.</p>
                <p><strong>Reasoning for Alternative Hypothesis:</strong> If version B effectively guides users to their desired actions faster, the average time spent on the page should decrease, reflecting an improvement in usability and efficiency.</p>
                <p><strong>Prediction with Justification:</strong> We are inclined to reject the null hypothesis, expecting that the design improvements in version B lead to a noticeable reduction in time on page.</p>

                <p><strong>Alternative Hypothesis (H1):</strong> Version B of the webpage results in a lower mouse move distance than version A.</p>
                <p><strong>Reasoning for Alternative Hypothesis:</strong> By making the user interface more direct and less cluttered, version B aims to reduce the need for extensive mouse movements, thereby increasing navigation efficiency.</p>
                <p><strong>Prediction with Justification:</strong> We predict rejecting the null hypothesis, as the improvements in version B are expected to significantly decrease the distance users need to move their mouse to find clickable elements.</p>

                <h3>Misclick Rate</h3>
                <p><strong>Test Choice ＆ Why: </strong>The Chi-Squared Test was selected to compare the misclick rates between versions A and B. This test is appropriate for categorical data, like our binary misclick outcomes.</p>
                <img src="misclick.png" alt="Misclick rate analysis">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chi-Squared Statistic:</strong> 3.689863013 indicates the observed data's deviation from the expected if no change had occurred. Closer values to 0 would indicate less deviation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Degrees of Freedom (df):</strong> 1, a function of the number of categories minus one.</li>
                    <li><strong>P-value:</strong> 0.05474411218, which is slightly above 0.05, suggests that while there is a trend towards improvement in version B, it is not statistically significant at the 5% level.</li>

                <p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Based on the P-value of 0.05474411218, which is more than the standard significance level of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that the change in misclick rates between versions A and B is not statistically significant.</p>

                <p><strong>Test Choice & Why: </strong>A One-Tailed T-Test was conducted to assess if version B of the webpage significantly decreases the mouse movement distance, aiming to validate our hypothesis that version B enhances user experience by requiring less navigation effort.</p>

                    <li><strong>T-score:</strong> 1.712585124, reflecting the direction and magnitude of the difference in means. Positive values indicate version B had lower times on page on average.</li>

                <p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Based on the adjusted P-value of 0.0469770285, which is less than the standard significance level of 0.05, we find statistically significant evidence that the alternative hypothesis is true, concluding that version B of the webpage significantly improves user experience by reducing navigation effort compared to version A.</p>

                <p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>Based on the adjusted P-value of 0.0302899617, which is less than the standard significance level of 0.05, we are confident that the alternative hypothesis is true, providing evidence that version B significantly reduces mouse movement, indicating improved navigation efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Summary Statistics</h2>
            <p>In our comparative analysis of user interactions with two versions of a webpage, we meticulously analyzed data from 34 data points for version A and 37 for version B across all metrics, indicating a solid foundation for our statistical conclusions. The analysis revealed a decrease in the <strong>average time</strong> on page from 12,860 for version A to 9,113 for version B, and in mouse movement distance from 4,007 to 2,978, highlighting version B’s enhanced user experience. The <strong>variances</strong> for time on page significantly dropped from 140,609,949 in version A to 24,097,853.98 in version B, and for mouse movement, from 6,401,849.319 to 3,738,366.765, indicating more consistent user behavior in version B. These results, supported by a substantial and specific dataset, clearly demonstrate the improvements in efficiency and navigation consistency brought by version B.</p>
