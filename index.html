      <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
      <p>To inform the design and functionality of the Movie Recommender, a competitive analysis was conducted on three popular movie websites: IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic. The analysis focused on several key aspects, including filtering options, sorting capabilities, user experience, and movie information presentation.</p>
      
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Factor</th>
            <th><a href="https://www.imdb.com/" target="_blank">IMDb</a></th>
            <th><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/" target="_blank">Rotten Tomatoes</a></th>
            <th><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/" target="_blank">Metacritic</a></th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Filtering Options</td>
            <td>&#10004;</td>
            <td>&#10006;</td>
            <td>&#10006;</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Sorting Capabilities</td>
            <td>&#10004;</td>
            <td>&#10004;</td>
            <td>&#10006;</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>User Experience</td>
            <td>&#10006;</td>
            <td>&#10004;</td>
            <td>&#10006;</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Movie Information</td>
            <td>&#10004;</td>
            <td>&#10006;</td>
            <td>&#10004;</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>Based on the analysis, several key insights were gained:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>IMDb excels in providing comprehensive filtering options and detailed movie information but could improve its user experience as potentially overwhelming interface for some users.</li>
        <li>Rotten Tomatoes offers a clean and intuitive user interface with effective sorting capabilities but lacks in-depth movie information.</li>
        <li>Metacritic provides detailed movie information and reviews but falls short in filtering options and overall user experience.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These insights were incorporated into the design and development of the Movie Recommender application, aiming to combine the strengths of each website while addressing their weaknesses.</p>

      <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
      <p>The competitive analysis revealed several areas where the Movie Recommender can differentiate itself:</p>
